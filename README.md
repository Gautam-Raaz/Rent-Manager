# 🏢 Rent Management System

A dual-interface rent management solution built to streamline the process of managing rental properties, renters, and their payments. The system consists of two apps:

1. **Dashboard App (Admin Panel)** – for landlords or property managers to manage rooms, renters, billing, and payments.
2. **Renter App** – for renters to view their dues, make payments, and access their rental information.
